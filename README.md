- 👋 Hi, I’m Dylan
- 👀 I’m interested in learning lots of different languages!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python on my own, while nailing down HTML/CSS through school.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to get a better understanding of different programming languages.
- 📫 How to reach me - Discord WarmMilk#0001; or if I ever cancel my Discord Nitro: WarmMilk#8123 (I'm most active here)
